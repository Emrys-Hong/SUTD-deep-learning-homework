## How to Run

The code was run in the jupyter notebooks, but if you want to run them in  `.py` file please go to `code/`

This is code structure: \
1. code/basics.py -> basic imports, you dont need to worry
2. code/transfer_learning.py -> transfer learning homework part
3. code/aug_task1.py -> augmentation homework task 1
4. code/aug_task2.py -> augmentation homework task 2
5. code/aug_task3_resnet50.py -> augmentation homeowrk task 3 model 1
6. code/aug_task3_densenet.py -> augmentation homework task 3 model 2

Please put the data in the same directory with the code in order to run. So, you should put `imagenet/` and `flowers102/` in the same folder with the code, depending on you want to run jupyter notebook or python file. \
please put `data.csv` under the `imagenet/` folder, in order to run the second task, because it take this as input.
